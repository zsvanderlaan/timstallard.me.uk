Hey There! I'm Tim, a 17 year old guy from Warwickshire who's a bit obsessed with technology. When I'm not sitting in lessons studying for my A Levels, you'll normally find me in a dark room, surrounded by screens, messing around with some code or servers.

I primarily do Web Development, starting with HTML when I was around 8, and more recently including some fun server-side projects using modern technologies such as Node.JS. I also enjoy working with computer hardware, ranging from building my own systems to maintaining a small homelab set of servers. While I'm a day-to-day Windows guy, I'm equally at home sitting at a Linux command line.
